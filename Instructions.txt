Hi! Thanks for (we hope) purchasing Advanced Ticket Bot!

First of all, our Discord server is the best place for support, so feel free to join here: https://discord.gg/g65H7W8

Before touching the bot at all, you'll want the most recent version of node.js on your computer or VPS. https://nodejs.org/en/
Install that, then come back here!

After installing node.js, you'll want to extract the files to either your desktop or VPS. These following steps are for a Windows PC, it's easy enough to find the alternatives for Linux.

You'll also need a developers app, which you can create at http://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me. If you're stuck, YouTube will help you. If you're still stuck after that, contact me!

1. Open the bot folder, and select config.json, configure that to your liking. The most important one to change is "token". That needs to be your bot token!
2. Edit any other settings you might want to edit.
3. For Windows, I've added a start.bat file. Just double click that, and if you've done the first two steps right, you'll be up and running!

If you do get problems, please contact me via our support server. Please have the error on hand so I can check it out without any messing around.

Any questions can also be asked on our support server!
